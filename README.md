## Extension Settings

Go to `Settings > Agent Scheduler` to access extension settings.

![Settings](https://github.com/ArtVentureX/sd-webui-agent-scheduler/assets/133728487/b0377ccd-f9bf-486e-8393-c06fe26aa117)

**Disable Queue Auto-Processing**: Check this option to disable queue auto-processing on start-up. You can also temporarily pause or resume the queue from the Extension tab.

**Queue Button Placement**: Change the placement of the queue button on the UI.

**Hide the Checkpoint Dropdown**: The Extension provides a custom checkpoint dropdown.

![Custom Checkpoint](https://github.com/ArtVentureX/sd-webui-agent-scheduler/assets/133728487/d110d314-a208-4eec-bb54-9f8c73cb450b)

By default, queued tasks use the currently loaded checkpoint. However, changing the system checkpoint requires some time to load the checkpoint into memory, and you also cannot change the checkpoint during image generation. You can use this dropdown to quickly queue a task with a custom checkpoint.

**Auto Delete Queue History**: Select a timeframe to keep your queue history. Tasks that are older than the configured value will be automatically deleted. Please note that bookmarked tasks will not be deleted.

## API Access

All the functionality of this extension can be accessed through HTTP APIs. You can access the API documentation via `http://127.0.0.1:7860/docs`. Remember to include `--api` in your startup arguments.

![API docs](https://github.com/ArtVentureX/sd-webui-agent-scheduler/assets/133728487/012ab2cc-b41f-4c68-8fa5-7ab4e49aa91d)

#### Queue Task

The two apis `/agent-scheduler/v1/queue/txt2img` and `/agent-scheduler/v1/queue/img2img` support all the parameters of the original webui apis. These apis response the task id, which can be used to perform updates later.

```json
{
  "task_id": "string"
}
```

#### Download Results

Use api `/agent-scheduler/v1/results/{id}` to get the generated images. The api supports two response format:

- json with base64 encoded

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN...",
      "infotext": "1girl\nNegative prompt: EasyNegative, badhandv4..."
    },
    {
      "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN...",
      "infotext": "1girl\nNegative prompt: EasyNegative, badhandv4..."
    }
  ]
}
```

- To update the extension, go to `Extension` tab and click `Check for Updates`, then click `Apply and restart UI`.
- To update the WebUI it self, you run the command `git pull origin master` in the same folder as webui.bat (or webui.sh).
